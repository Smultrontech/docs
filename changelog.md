### Features

* You can now edit your account name and profile image in the account page
* Manufacturing date field on yeast, integrated with yeast starter calculator
* Changed to a little thicker font on PDF
* Now shows time field on hop for first wort and mash hops when boil time is 0 \(raw beer\). To help with IBU calculations for raw beer

### Fixed

* Yeast calculator recalculating wrong amount when using gram as unit on the yeast
* Rice hulls \(adjunct\) no longer affect mash water calculation

## 1.6.3 - 22.02.2019

### New

* You can now add a tag when importing multiple recipes at once from BeerXML
* Amount of dry hop per volume shown below hops in recipe designer
* Improved PDF layout, changed font, line change now work in recipe notes, added recipe color box
* Fermentables with use **Bottling** will now use estimated bottling volume to determine gravity potential

## 1.6.2 - 19.02.2019

### New

* When altering trub/chiller loss in the equipment profile, the brewhouse efficiency is reestimated instead of the mash efficiency
* When switching between Kettle and Fermenter as batch volume target in equipment profile, the profile will calculate new batch size so it matches fermenter volume on both settings
* Now only shows Mash efficiency when using Kettle as batch volume target, since it is the only efficiency needed to calculate correct OG for these types of eq. profiles
* Added a few new Norsk Malt grain

### Fixed

* Fix batch page freezing on brewing tab when on a extract recipe with 0 boil time and no hop stand \(no brewing stages or brewing steps for brew tracker\)
* Fixed various minor issues with using Kettle as batch volume target in equipment profile, you will now get same results from a recipe independent of batch volume target when they have the same values and volumes. If you have previously had success with using kettle as batch volume target you might need to tweak your profile a little
* Potential from sugar/extract now takes into account trub/chiller loss instead of using fermenter volume directly, this might slightly lower OG on recipes with trub/chiller loss were sugar or extract is used, depeding on the amount of loss in your equipment profile. This is a common error in _other tools_, and if you want your OG to match _other tools_, this _"feature"_ can be enabled again in the experimental settings.
* Fixed fermentable type was not set properly in recipe designer for _other_, _liquid extract_ and _adjunct_ after version 1.6.0

## 1.6.1 - 14.02.2019

## 1.6.0 - 12.02.2019

### Changed

First time you open the app there will now be a popup asking you to accept the terms and conditions. This will only show once, or if the terms are updated.

### Features

* You can now **add manual readings and get a fermentation chart** in your batch
* Added support for **stepped starters** and **improved the yeast starter tool** it will now show yeast cell count and pitch rate in recipe, and recalculate if the recipe changes. The data entered in the starter calculation tool within a recipe is remembered and stored in the recipe
* **New summary section in the batch**, this will recalculate the original recipe based on measured values and give you updated values and you can compare the original recipe values to the recalculated values. There is also the possiblity to view the adjusted recipe. You can also copy this recipe and/or its equipment profile. This way you can create an equipment profile from measured values.
* When deleting a batch it will now check if you have removed any ingredients from the inventory, and ask if you want to return it, also added undo remove from inventory button
* **Danish Beer Style Guidelines** \(DÃ˜LD 2017\)
* **New yeast** added WLP067, M29, all **Bootleg Biology yeasts**

* Fermentation Chart: Fixed temperature y-axis when using Fahrenheit
* Fix hopstand temp on brew-tracker
* SG readings from remote logging devices are now rounded

## 1.5.0 - 15.01.2019

### Important

When logging with **Tilt**, **you must now attach it to the batch** rather than putting the batch name in the "beer name" field of the Tilt App / TiltPi. 

_Beer name will still work **temporarily** to not break any ongoing logging. If you have attached the Tilt, the attached batch will be prioritized over the "beer name" field._ 

_This is to simplify and avoid confusion where the batch is not logging even when attached because there is something entered in the beer name field._

### Changed

Power-ups \(integrations\) are now restricted to Premium users only. The free Premium period for new users are extended from 24 to 30 days to give some more time for new users to test these features. _Ongoing logging will not be interrupted._

If multiple temperatures are present, it will use a weighted average. If you have not corrected for this manually before, IBU on your hopstand recipes might change to a more correct value
* Show **count** next to categories in Recipes and Batches page
* Show kJ in alcohol tool
* New export option for readings: CSV file
* You can now select overflow target for the sparge-water limit in the equipment profile. Now defaults to Top-Up Water \(Boil\) rather than Mash-Water

* Added fermentation start date field in fermentation tab of batch
* Last carbonation type used is remembered
* Inventory page: New toggle to show only items with negative inventory \(when negative inventory enabled\)
* Adjust \(add / substract\) button on the ingredients in the inventory
* _New section in settings for experimental features \(new features that is not yet completed or fully tested can be enabled in settings at your own risk - Premium users only\)_

### Fixed

* Fix OG scaling not working if Potential / Extract was missing on fermentable
