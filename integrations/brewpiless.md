# BrewPiLess

Go into the settings page in [Brewfather APP](https://web.brewfather.app/), enable Brewpiless. You will then get a **URL**, **Data Type** and **Format** that you need to copy into the Brewpiless remote logging configuration page.

**Set log time period to 900 seconds**. Your Brewpiless should then log every 15 minutes.

After the Brewpiless has done its first logging to Brewfather, it will appear in the device list located in your Batch &gt; Fermentation &gt; Readings &gt; **Devices**. Click on the Devices button and attatch your Brewpiless to the batch. The next time your Brewpiless logs, it will show up in your batch!

**Never log more than once every 15 minutes**, request logged more often than that will be ignored.
