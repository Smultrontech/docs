# MyBrewbot

## What is MyBrewbot?

The MyBrewbot for Tilt, which has a bluetooth receiver to collect the Tilt data, controls the temperature of the fermenting wort and sends the logging data to Brewfather. This can be a good alternative to using a [TiltPi](tilt-hydrometer.md#tiltpi-setup) as you can also control your heating and cooling with this unit based on the Tilt readings and/or external temperature sensor. Both the gravity and temperature \(and all other data sent\) will be logged to Brewfather.

Your MyBrewbot should then log every 15 minutes.

After the MyBrewbot has done its first logging to Brewfather, it will appear in the device list located in your Batch &gt; Fermentation &gt; Readings &gt; **Devices**. Click on the Devices button and attatch your MyBrewbot to the batch. The next time your MyBrewbot logs, it will show up in your batch!
