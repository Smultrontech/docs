# MyBrewbot

Using MyBrewbot with Brewfather is very simple. Enable it in your Settings and copy the Logging ID into your MyBrewbot settings.

![2. Copy the Logging ID into the Brewfather User ID field in the MyBrewbot web config](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2841%29.png)

Your MyBrewbot should then log every 15 minutes.

After the MyBrewbot has done its first logging to Brewfather, it will appear in the device list located in your Batch &gt; Fermentation &gt; Readings &gt; **Devices**. Click on the Devices button and attatch your MyBrewbot to the batch. The next time your MyBrewbot logs, it will show up in your batch!
