# MyBrewbot

## What is MyBrewbot?

The MyBrewbot for Tilt, which has a bluetooth receiver to collect the Tilt data, controls the temperature of the fermenting wort and sends the logging data to Brewfather. This can be a good alternative to using a [TiltPi](tilt-hydrometer.md#tiltpi-setup) as you can also control your heating and cooling with this unit based on the Tilt readings and/or external temperature sensor. Both the gravity and temperature \(and all other data sent\) will be logged to Brewfather.
