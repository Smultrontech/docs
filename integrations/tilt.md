# Tilt Hydrometer

Drop your Tilt in the fermenter or a glass of water, go into the settings page in [Brewfather APP](https://web.brewfather.app), enable Tilt. You will then get a cloud URL that you need to copy into the **Cloud URL** in your Tilt-app or TiltPi settings. You then need to enter your **batch number** as the beer name in your Tilt-app or TiltPi settings. Write a comment and click enter/send to log immediately.

**Never log more than once every 15 minutes**, request logged more often than that will be ignored. This is the default value of the Tilt.
