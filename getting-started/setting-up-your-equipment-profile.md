# Setting up your equipment profile

To set up your Equipment profile, select the Profiles page from the menu. Click Equipment, and add a new profile, or edit the default profile.

![Equipment profile is customizable to get the right numbers for your system](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

**Name:** Name for your equipment profile

**Boil Time:** Boil time for this equipment profile, if you adjust boil time when "Calc boil volume" is activated, the pre-boil volume will change to match the new boil time based on boiloff.

### Volumes

**Batch Volume Target:** Select if you want your Batch Volume to match final volume in fermenter \(recommended\), or end of boil kettle volume.

**Batch Volume:** Your final batch volume target, a factor in calculating your Original Gravity.

**Calc boil volume:** Automatically calculates your Pre-Boil Volume if this is active calculated back from batch volume. Based on your boiloff rate and trub/chiller loss, and 4% shrinkage.

**Pre-Boil Volume:** Set your pre-boil volume manually or have it calculated automatically \(recommended\).

**Boil Off:** How much you boiloff per hour with your setup, important factor in calculating Pre-Boil Volume.

**Trub/Chiller Loss:** How much you loose in trub/chilling from kettle to fermenter

**Mash-Tun Deadspace:** Recoverable deadspace volume in your mash-tun

**Mash-Tun Loss:** **Un**recoverable deadspace volume in your mash-tun and/or mash volume lost in your mash process

**Fermenter Loss:** Expected loss from fermenter to bottle/keg

**HLT Deadspace** is any dead space in the Hot Liquor Tank. For example, if you use a sparge water heater that has the tap that draws higher than the bottom of the pot, you can set the liters that are not drawn. This volume will be added to the sparge water amount in the Water Adjustment Calculator, for calculating your sparge water additions.

### Efficiency

**Brewhouse Efficiency:** The overall efficiency of you system - includes all losses to the fermenter. Important factor in calculating you Original Gravity. If you don't know you system, a good number to start with might be 70-75%. And you can dail in your excact efficiency after a couple of brews.

**Mash Efficiency:** The efficiency of your mash procedure, up to pre-boil, including sparging. Important factor in calculating your Pre-Boil Gravity.

It is recommended to automatically calculate your mash efficiency by enabling the **Calc mash efficiency** checkbox.
