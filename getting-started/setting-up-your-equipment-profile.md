# Setting up your equipment profile

![Equipment profile is customizable to get the right numbers for your system](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

**Name:** Name for your equipment profile

**Boil Time:** Boil time for this equipment profile, if you adjust boil time when "Calc boil volume" is activated, the pre-boil volume will change to match the new boil time based on boiloff.

### Volumes

**Batch Volume Target:** Select if you want your Batch Volume to match final volume in fermenter \(recommended\), or end of boil kettle volume.

**Batch Volume:** Your final batch volume target, a factor in calculating your Original Gravity.

**Calc boil volume:** Automatically calculates your Pre-Boil Volume if this is active calculated back from batch volume. Based on your boiloff rate and trub/chiller loss, and 4% shrinkage.

**Pre-Boil Volume:** Set your pre-boil volume manually or have it calculated automatically \(recommended\).

**Boil Off:** How much you boiloff per hour with your setup, important factor in calculating Pre-Boil Volume.

**Trub/Chiller Loss:** How much you loose in trub/chilling from kettle to fermenter

**Mash-Tun Deadspace:** Recoverable deadspace volume in your mash-tun

**Mash-Tun Loss:** **Un**recoverable deadspace voume in your mash-tun

**Fermenter Loss:** Expected loss from fermenter to bottle/keg

### Efficiency

**Brewhouse Efficiency:** The overall efficiency of you system - includes all losses to the fermenter. Important factor in calculating you Original Gravity. If you don't know you system, a good number to start with might be 70-75%. And you can dail in your excact efficiency after a couple of brews.

**Mash Efficiency:** The efficiency of your mash procedure, up to pre-boil, including sparging. Important factor in calculating your Pre-Boil Gravity.

It is recommended to automatically calculate your mash efficiency by enabling the **Calc mash efficiency** checkbox.
