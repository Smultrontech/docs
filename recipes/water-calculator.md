## Set up your Source water profile

Go to profiles in the main menu and select Water. Select the default source profile, and adjust the values to match your water report. For more info click the link below.

## Locate the water calculator

Normally you do not want to start adjusting your water until the rest of your recipe is done. When you have created you recipe and are ready to start adjusting your water you will find the water calculator in the water section of the recipe designer.

![Click the CALC button to open the water calculator](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

This will open the water calculator.

At the top you will see your current mash water room temperature pH. **All pH values should be measured when the wort is cooled down to room temperature**.

There is a cog icon which allows you to change some settings regarding the water calculator. More on this later.

## Grains

The fist section of the water calculator shows your grain bill, and the calculator automatically assings a grain type to it. Verify that the grain and **grain color** matches the grains you will be using, and that the **grain type** is correct.

If you use any **crystal**, **roasted** or **acidulated malt**, make sure they are assigned the right category as they have a big impact on the estimated pH. Adjust if needed.

You can also ignore the grain, making it not count towards the pH calculation. Usefull if you are just steeping that spesific grain.

## Water Volumes

Next section shows your water volumes, pulled from your recipe and equipment profile. Make sure they are correct. Adjust levels if needed. For example you might want to add more sparge water volume if you have some dead-space in the sparge water heater.

## Water Source

Your default water source profile is preselected and should normally not need any alterations if you have already set up your water profile. If you have multiple source water profile, you can click the change button as needed to choose another profile as your source.

## Target Profile \(optional\)

If you want to target a specific water profile for your water adjustment you can optionally select or create a target profile. The target profile is used for when you want to use the auto adjust feature to match your source water against this target. The target water profile is also what shows as a diff under your total water profile when adjusting.

## Style Comparsion

![General style recommendation](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The style section allows you to compare your total water profile against a general recommended range or against a specific style recommendation.

If your target profile is above or below the recommended range it will show as red. And green if you are withing the recommended range.
