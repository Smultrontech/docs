###  Scale recipe

Change the batch size or efficiency in your equipment profile within a recipe, click save and it will ask you if you want to scale the recipe to match the new numbers. Also - if you change to another equipment profile it will ask if you want to scale to match it also!

### Deleting recipe

Click the menu button in the lower right then Delete.

### Profiles in existing recipes

When you change a profile \(equipment, mash, fermentation, water\) from the **profiles page**, you have to reselect it in your recipe after you change it. This is because a profile in the recipe is not updated automatically to avoid breaking recipes unintentionally, it will stay at the same value as the profile had when the recipe was created. this goes for all profile types. New recipes will have the updated profile that you starred as default.
