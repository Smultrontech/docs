In the public recipe  you can search for recipes shared by other Brewfather users. Located as a new page called "Library" in the menu.

To share your recipes in the library there is now a new "padlock" icon in the recipe designer. Clicking this you can toggle the recipe to be publicly available.

All users can view and download recipes. Upload \(and voting\) of recipes are for Premium users only.

Text search can be used to search for all the visible text fields, inlcuding recipe name, style, tags, profile name. More filtering options will come later as the library grows.

#### New public profile creation

Be quick and reserve your brewery profile name today, this is unique and will be used to identify you in future Brewfather community features. 

The first time you try to share a recipe, you will be asked to create a public profile where you upload a brewery avatar, and choose your brewey profile name and so on. You can also initialize the public profile creator from the account page. Only premium users can create a public profile.

## Match copied recipes to your equipment

When you copy someones recipe and want to brew it yourself here is a couple of suggestions:

Open the recipe and click change equipment, select your own equipment profile, then it will ask you to scale when you click save. Then it will scale ingredients to match your efficiency and volumes. 

* If the recipe has hopstand, double check that hopstand-temp is the same in your equipment profile before you click save. 
* If you do water adjustments, open the water-calculator and re-do them to match your water. It could also be wise to open the yeat calculator and redo that to your liking and to get whole numbers.

After doing this the recipe will match your equipment.
